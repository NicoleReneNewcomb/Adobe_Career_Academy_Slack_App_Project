This is Nicole-Rene's Slack App project created as part of the Adobe Career Academy 2023 program. The Lambda version of this
App is designed to operate on AWS Lambda (a FaaS, serverless
platform). This program uses libraries including slack_sdk,
slack_bolt, and openai. Environment variables are configured
in AWS Lambda settings.
